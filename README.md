# Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction

This repository documents materials related to the **Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction**,  
a neutral observational framework for recording state transitions that occur after optimization in human–AI interaction.

Within this frame, state transitions are recorded without reintroducing intention, meaning, purpose, or evaluation.  
The framework does not model optimization processes or learning dynamics.  
It records what transitions occurred and how structural differences between states can be observed.

The internal recording structure used within this observational frame has previously been referred to as *State Transition Trace (STT)*.  
Current and authoritative definitions are archived via OSF.
