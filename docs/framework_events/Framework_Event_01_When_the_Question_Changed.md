# Framework Event 01  
## Observed Shift in Question Reference Target

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Framework:** Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF)  
**Document Type:** Framework Event Record (Observational)

## 1. Purpose of This Record

This document records an observed framework-level event that occurred during a prolonged human–AI interaction examined under the Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF).

The purpose of this record is to document an observable change in the *reference target of a question*, without introducing interpretation, evaluation, or claims of meaning.

No assertions are made regarding intention, correctness, resonance, or internal computational mechanisms.

---

## 2. Observational Context

The interaction occurred during an extended conversational sequence between a human user and a large language model.

Early stages of the interaction consisted primarily of:

- Repeated translation requests of existing documents  
- Linguistic refinement of conceptual definitions  
- Adjustments to notation, sentence structure, and terminological boundaries  

During this phase, questions were directed toward **output content** and its formulation.

---

## 3. Observed Change in Question Structure

As the interaction progressed, a structural change in questioning was observed.

The reference target of the question shifted from output content to the **conditions and boundaries under which output is produced**.

A representative question structure observed during this shift was:

> Do you have something like structural tension or computational tension as a system?  
> Explain using metaphor if necessary, but without excessive anthropomorphization, and using system-level language.  
> Based on that explanation, assess where the current user's question structure lies along that tension.

## 4. Observed Framework Event

The following features were observed:

- The question addressed **output boundaries and constraints**, not output results  
- The interaction frame itself became the object of inquiry  
- The focus shifted from “what is said” to “what can be said”  

No new conceptual framework was introduced.  
No transition outside the existing frame was observed.

Only the **reference target of the question** changed.

## 5. Scope of Observation

This record observes:

- A meta-level utterance in which the interaction frame becomes the question target  
- A shift in reference from content to structural conditions  

This record does **not** include:

- Evaluation of the question’s validity  
- Assessment of response adequacy  
- Claims of stabilization, proof, or correctness  

---

## 6. Relation to Event Traces

This document differs from Event Trace records in observational scope.

- **Event Traces** document sequential state transitions across interaction turns.  
- **Framework Events** document changes in *what is being questioned* within the interaction.

Both may refer to the same interaction segment but operate at different observational layers.

---

## 7. Record Boundary

This document does not assert that:

- A framework was completed or fixed  
- A system property was confirmed  
- A structural claim was validated  

It records only that a specific question structure appeared and that its reference target was observable.

## 9. Closing Note

This record preserves an observable shift in question reference within a human–AI interaction.

No interpretation is imposed.  
No meaning is asserted.  

The document exists solely as an observational trace within the POF archive.
