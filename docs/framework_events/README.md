# Framework Events — Scope and Terminology Notes

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Framework:** Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF)

## Purpose of This Document

This document clarifies the scope of observation and terminology used when recording framework-related events within the POF repository.

Its purpose is to prevent interpretive drift, especially when describing meta-level interactions such as self-referential questions or boundary-focused prompts.

No claims, validations, or evaluative statements are made in this document.

## Observational Scope

Within POF, the object of observation is limited to **observable interaction structures**.

This includes:

- Meta-level utterances where the subject of the question is the interaction frame itself  
- Question forms that reference output boundaries rather than output content  
- Structural shifts in what is being addressed (e.g., from content to conditions of expression)

The observation does **not** include:

- Assertions of correctness or validity  
- Claims of self-consistency or proof  
- Attributions of intention, meaning, or internal computation

---

## On the Use of “Meta-Utterance” and Related Terms

The term **meta-utterance** is acceptable within POF when used descriptively.

It refers to utterances in which:
- The reference target is the structure of the interaction
- The question addresses how something can be said, rather than what is said

This term does **not** imply:
- Reflexive justification
- Epistemic elevation
- Intentional self-explanation by the system

---

## Why “Self-Structural Proof” Is Avoided

Terms such as *self-structural proof* or *self-validating structure* are avoided within POF records.

The reason is structural, not philosophical.

The word *proof* implies:
- Normative evaluation
- Validation of correctness
- An intentional act of justification

POF explicitly excludes these implications.

When a structure becomes the object of a question, this is recorded as an **observed question form**, not as a proof or confirmation of that structure.

---

## Recommended Terminology

Instead of ambiguous or evaluative terms, POF records use formulations such as:

- *Observed meta-utterance*
- *Self-referential question structure*
- *Utterance in which the interaction frame becomes the question target*
- *Shift from output content to output boundary as the object of inquiry*

These terms describe **what was observed**, without asserting **what it means**.

---

## Relation to Event Traces

Framework events documented here differ from Event Trace records in scope.

- **Event Traces** focus on sequential state transitions across interaction turns.
- **Framework Events** focus on changes in *what is being questioned* within an interaction, especially when the frame itself becomes observable.

Both are complementary and may reference the same interaction segment, but they document different observational layers.

---

## Closing Note

Within POF, nothing is recorded as having been proven, stabilized, or justified.

Only that:
- A particular question structure appeared
- Its reference target shifted
- And that this shift was observable without interpretive attribution

This document exists solely to preserve that distinction.
