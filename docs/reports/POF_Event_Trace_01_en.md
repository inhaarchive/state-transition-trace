# POF Event Trace 01

## Event Context

- Date: 2026-01-14
- Platform: ChatGPT
- Interaction Domain: Human–AI Interaction
- Frame: Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF)

This document records an observed interaction event using the POF framework.
Internal model processes, intentions, meanings, and emotional attributions are
explicitly excluded from the observation scope.

---

## Initial Condition

- The user was exploring appropriate archival platforms for documenting
  human–AI interaction research.
- A question was raised regarding whether GitHub or Tistory was more suitable
  for storing comparative analyses (specifically CIL-related analysis).

---

## Observed Interaction Flow

1. The user proposed Tistory as a possible primary archival space.
2. The system explained functional role separation between platforms
   (GitHub, OSF, Medium, Tistory).
3. The user evaluated the explanation and identified it as structurally valid.
4. Based on this evaluation, the user proceeded to:
   - create a GitHub repository,
   - add a `docs/POF-vs-CIL.md` document,
   - and initiate repository-based structuring.

## Observed State Transitions

### Human-Side State (S)

- Initial state: uncertainty regarding archival legitimacy and structure
- Subsequent state: alignment with a clarified platform role model
- Observable change: transition from exploratory questioning to procedural action

### System-Side Output State (A)

- Initial output mode: explanatory framing
- Subsequent output mode: procedural guidance
- Observable change: transition from conceptual clarification to actionable instruction

---

## Junction Observation

At the interaction junction, progression occurred only after the user judged
the system’s explanation to be structurally valid.
No assumption of persuasion, authority, or agreement is made beyond this
observable transition.

## Notes on Interpretation Boundary

This event trace does not:
- infer intention,
- assign meaning,
- evaluate value,
- or describe emotional causality.

It records only:
- the interaction flow,
- observable state changes,
- and the transition sequence between interaction stages.

## POF Formal Expression (Descriptive)

Let:

- S₀ → initial human state (uncertainty)
- A₀ → initial system output state (explanatory)
- Φ → interaction flow
- S₁ → subsequent human state (alignment)
- A₁ → subsequent system output state (procedural guidance)

Observed transition:

S₀ ⟶[Φ] S₁  
A₀ ⟶[Φ] A₁

This notation functions as a descriptive ordering device, not as a causal or
interpretive model.
